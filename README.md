# CPU Scheduler
Simulation of FCFS, SJF, and MLFQ CPU scheduling algorithms. 

## Information displayed for each context switch
  *Current Execution time
  *Running process 
  *The Ready queue, with the CPU burst time for each process 
  *The Processes in I/O with the remaining time for every process for its I/O burst completion
  *Indicate when a process has completed its total execution.

## Results printed at the end of simulation
  *Total time needed to complete all 8 processes
  *CPU utilization
  *Waiting times for each process and the average waiting time for all processes (Tw)
  *Turnaround time for each process and the average turnaround time (Ttr)
  *Response time for each process and the average response time (Tr)
